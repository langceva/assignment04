## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Loading the data

The analysis for this assignment was done utilizing data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, found here \*\*INSERT LINK\*\*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
data <- read_dta("New_Comprehensive_September_22_2025.dta")
```

## Visualization #1: Gender Distribution of Top Managers

```{r}
manager_data <- data |>
  filter(!is.na(b7a)) |>
  mutate(manager_gender = if_else(b7a == 1, "Female", "Male")) |>
  count(manager_gender) |>
  mutate(
    percentage = n / sum(n) * 100,
    label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")
  )

ggplot(manager_data, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = manager_gender)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            size = 5, color = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(
    title = "Gender Distribution of Top Managers",
    subtitle = "Percentage of firms where the head is female vs. male",
    caption = "Source: World Bank Enterprise Survey",
    fill = "Manager Gender"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Female" = "darkgreen", "Male" = "steelblue")) +
  theme_void() 
```
